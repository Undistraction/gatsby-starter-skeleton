This site is both a demo and documentation for
[Gatsby Skeleton Starter](https://github.com/Undistraction/gatsby-skeleton-starter),
a comprehensive starter for the static site generator
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) offering a wide variety of features and a
simple design ready for customisation. Additional information is available in
the project's
[Github repo](https://github.com/Undistraction/gatsby-skeleton-starter).

You will find information about the feature included in the
[Articles](/articles) of this site. Use it to learn from or as the basis for
your own Gatsby site.

For information on using starters with Gatsby, see Gatsby's own documentation
[here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-starters/#gatsby-starters).

If you encounter any problems, have any questions, or suggestions for improving
the starter, please use the project's
[issues](https://github.com/Undistraction/gatsby-skeleton-starter/issues).
